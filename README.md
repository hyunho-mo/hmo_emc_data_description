# GPU Cluster Research Handover Documentation

This repository provides documentation and handover instructions for datasets, code implementations, and workflows located on the GPU cluster environment.

The purpose of this repository is to facilitate knowledge transfer and ensure continuity of ongoing and future research activities by providing:

- Overview of available datasets and their organization
- Instructions for accessing and using data on the cluster
- Implementation details of preprocessing and analysis pipelines
- Notes on reproducibility and execution procedures

⚠️ The actual datasets remain stored securely on institutional infrastructure and are **not included** in this repository.  
This repository serves as a guide to understand and reproduce the workflows.

# 1. Data

Four datasets were used:

- ERGO (Rotterdam Study)
- ErasmusStrokeStudy
- Stanford_AIMI-COCA
- ELSA-Brasil

All datasets are stored at: /data/scratch/hmo


The folder names correspond directly to the dataset names listed above.
